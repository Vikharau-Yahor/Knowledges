To create a new SSH key pair:



Open a terminal Git Bash / WSL on Windows.




Generate a new ED25519 SSH key pair:


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"

Or, if you want to use RSA:


ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

Next, you will be prompted to input a file path to save your SSH key pair to.


If you don't already have an SSH key pair, use the suggested path by pressing
Enter. 
Using the suggested path will normally allow your SSH client
to automatically use the SSH key pair with no additional configuration.


If you already have an SSH key pair with the suggested file path, you will need 

to input a new file path and declare what host
this SSH key pair will be used for in your ~/.ssh/config file.




Once the path is decided, you will be prompted to input a password to 
secure your new SSH key pair. 
It's a best practice to use a password, 
but it's not required and you can skip creating it by pressing
Enter twice.

Now you can use public SSH in gitlab, and specify public sertificate in client-git-apps
