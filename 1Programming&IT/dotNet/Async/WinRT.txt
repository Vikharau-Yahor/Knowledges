WinRT - it's API (types/methods library) which can be used outside the .net: by C++, by c# or other.
It can't contains .net specified types and features, so if you wish to write async methods for the WinRT you will have to use 2 interfaces:
- IAsyncAction (winMD interface) which mapped on Task
- IAsyncOperation<T> (winMD inteface) which mapped on Task<T>
