Need to configure firewall on host machine to allow connections to some port

What I did for Elders game:
---Allow process----
1) Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Defender Firewall -> Allowed apps
2) Change settings
3) Allow another app
4) Browse -> find your game .exe (e.g. Elders.exe in build folder)
5) Tick 'private' and 'public' -> add

--- Allow port ----
ref: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/report-server/configure-a-firewall-for-report-server-access?view=sql-server-ver16
1) Control Panel -> System and Security -> Windows Defender Firewall
2) Advanced Settings -> Inbound Rules
3) New rule
	- select Port
	- select TCP + specify host game port in 'specific local ports' (e.g. 7778)
	- select 'Allow the connection'
	- tick all (Domain, private, public)
	- add some name (e.g. eldersTCP)
4) add new rule with same params but specify UDP instead of TCP



********************
Useful PS commands for checking state of port
********************
--Check that port is listened
	netstat -ano | findstr :7778

--Check info about process returned from command above
	tasklist | findstr 636

--Test forwarded port (didn't work for me :( )
	test-netconnection -computername localhost -port 7778
