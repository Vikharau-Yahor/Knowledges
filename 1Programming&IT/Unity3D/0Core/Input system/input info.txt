Quick info (06/2021)
**********
Unity's build in Input manager is deprecated(Edit -> Project settings -> Input manager)

Latest input mechanic is 'Input sytem' (distributed as separate package)


************
Setup Flow
**************
1) Install package
2) Edit -> Projects settings -> Input system -> create settings
3) Select your Player game obj and add 'Player Input' component
4) Click 'Create actions' (it will generate base set of inputs)
5) Check Behavior property of 'Player Input' component -- it defines how this component will notify other components when some Input is used/pressed
	- Send Messages	-- Uses GameObject.SendMessage on the GameObject that the PlayerInput component belongs to.
	- Broadcast messages -- same as above but messages are also sent to child objects
	- ...other types are event-based
6) In case of 'Send Messages' you can create additional script which would handle input actions:
	- add script component on the same object like Player input
	- define message handle methods like:
		//you can make it parameterless
		public void OnMove(InputValue value)
	- check some samples in 3D third person template unity project
