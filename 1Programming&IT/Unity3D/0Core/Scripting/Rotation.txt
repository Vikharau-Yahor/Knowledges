****************
Euler angle
****************
Euler angle is a Vector3 which reprezent x,y,z rotation of the object.
Don't try to manipulate x,y,z directly as changing of this values leads to unexpected transform rotation changes
Need to use Quaternion types for object rotations, euler can be used only for input params.

Facts:
- Inpsector rotation is not Euler angle.
- rotation by x and z will cause unexpected results as it doesn't rotate relative world axises
- only rotation by Y will lead to expected result.

Quaternion
***********
Best solution for object rotation changes. Don't try to manually change some params inside, use methods:
- RotateTowards -- rotates RotationA to RotationB by N degrees
	var rotationDelta = _movementState.RotationSpeedDegrees * Time.deltaTime;
	Quaternion.RotateTowards(currentRotation, targetRotation, rotationDelta)
