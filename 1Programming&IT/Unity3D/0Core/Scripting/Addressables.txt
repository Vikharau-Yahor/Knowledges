*****************
Setup part:
1) Window -> Asset Management -> Addressables -> Groups -> Settings
2) Change 'Build addressables on Player build' if you need to include assets build in simple build process

2) Add asset to group 
(you will see in inspector that the asset is marked as addressable)
3) Load asset runtime by
	- String address
	- Label (for group of assets)
	- AddressReference (direct link)


*************
Main parts
*************
- Groups 
	-- stores various assets
	-- determines how assets should be build (pathes, bundling mode and etc)

- AssetReference -- means reference to an asset which you can use to load asset (prefab and etc)
	private AssetReferenceGameObject prefabRef;
	prefabRef.LoadAssetAsync(); //LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>().Completed += OnAssetLoad;
	if (prefabRef.Asset)
		Instantiate(prefabRef.Asset, position, Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;

	prefabRef.ReleaseAsset();
