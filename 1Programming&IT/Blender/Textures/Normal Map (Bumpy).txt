Normal map controls how bumpy i.e. height for some parts of your texture.
Normal map can be connected directly with BSDF if you have special Blue-like image which contains normal map data

*********
Paint Setup
****************
Normal map can be painted and result can be baked to Normal texture
1) Create three nodes: Image texture --> Bumpy Map -> Principled BSDF
2) Setup Image texture:
	- 32 bit (for increasing quality, otherwise it can be pixelated)
	- set resolution which is x * 512
	- Color space to Non-color
	- set base color to the position RGB (0.5,0.5,0.5) which in the middle between black and white (darker value -- texture poping out, whiter -- going in, so)
	- Interpolation to Cubic (recommendation)
3) Connect 'Image texture' color with Height socket of 'Bumpy Map'
4) Connect Normal sockets between Bumpy node and Shader

*************
Texture paint
**************
Use Mix brush with color values between Black-White:
1) 'Bolts', dots paint --> Stroke: Anchored
2) Stroke: Line
3) Paint with texture
	- Tools section (on right panel) -> Brush settings -> Texture
	- Add new texture
	- Change Type to some precedural texture

Notes:
1) Set brush force under 0.02 (or even 0.002) if you wish to make smth slitely bumpy
