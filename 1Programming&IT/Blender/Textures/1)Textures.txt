Texture maps:
- Color map (can be named as color, albedo, base color or diffuse) -- main image which represents in set of colors which your model will have
- Displacement map
- Roughness map 
- Normal map -- controls bumps. Normal map node must exist between Image texture with normal map and Shader node.
	-- NormalGL -- Blender's Eeeve/cycles work with this better
	-- NormalDX
- Metallic -- what part is more/less metall (white means more metallic)
- Opacity -- connects to Alpha node, determinse what parts of texture will/won't be rendered
- Emission map -- controls which part of texture emit light + color of light


Notes: 
1) all map texture nodes which doesn't affect color must have Color space: 'Non-color' (e.g. metallic, Normal, )
